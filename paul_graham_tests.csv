test_0,"What does Paul Graham say about startups and product/market fit?","Paul Graham says startups must find product/market fit by iterating quickly, focusing on a small user base, and improving the product until users love it.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","[""Paul Graham: Startups succeed when they find product/market fit — a small group of users who love the product."",""From the essay: iterate fast, listen to users, and do something people want rather than scaling prematurely."",""Note: focus on a narrow market first and make the product compelling for them before expanding.""]","good retrieval"
test_1,"What does Paul Graham say about startups and product/market fit?","Paul Graham argues that startups should start with a narrow audience, iterate fast, and make a product that a small group of users truly wants.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","Paul Graham: Startups succeed when they find product/market fit — a small group of users who love the product. ||| From the essay: iterate fast, listen to users, and do something people want rather than scaling prematurely. ||| Note: focus on a narrow market first and make the product compelling for them before expanding.","paraphrase"
test_2,"How should a startup approach product/market fit?","Paul Graham: find a small group of users who love the product, iterate, and improve until it fits their needs.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","[""Paul Graham: Startups succeed when they find product/market fit — a small group of users who love the product."",""From the essay: iterate fast, listen to users, and do something people want rather than scaling prematurely.""]","good snippet"
test_3,"What is product/market fit according to Paul Graham?","Product/market fit is when a small but passionate user base loves your product and keeps using it.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","Paul Graham: Startups succeed when they find product/market fit — a small group of users who love the product. ||| Note: focus on a narrow market first and make the product compelling for them before expanding.","paraphrase"
test_4,"Should startups scale early per Paul Graham?","Paul Graham says scale early to capture market share quickly and raise funding.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","[""Paul Graham: Startups succeed when they find product/market fit — a small group of users who love the product."",""From the essay: iterate fast, listen to users, and do something people want rather than scaling prematurely.""]","incorrect claim (generator error)"
test_5,"How important is iteration to product/market fit?","Iteration is key—Paul Graham stresses iterating quickly and listening to users to reach product/market fit.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","Note: focus on a narrow market first and make the product compelling for them before expanding. ||| From the essay: iterate fast, listen to users, and do something people want rather than scaling prematurely.","partial (mentions iteration but missing 'small group')"
test_6,"Does Paul Graham recommend focusing on a small initial market?","Yes — he suggests concentrating on a narrow market first and making the product compelling for them.","Startups should concentrate on finding product/market fit: build for a small group, iterate quickly, and refine until users strongly want the product.","[""Note: focus on a narrow market first and make the product compelling for them before expanding.""]","evidence-only chunk"
